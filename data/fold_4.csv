One defintion of idiot in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary is:

""a foolish or stupid person""

So, relative to firing Comey, Trump was both stupid and foolish.  Evidence?  Mueller, Bannon and general ongoing controversy.

Relative to new smear campaign against Comey?  Stupid and foolish.  The talkiing points miss the pint, but more importantly, they re-raise how stupid and foolish he was to fire Comey in the first place.  Lester Holt's interview gets more views on Youtube.

Plus, just overall, he's stupid and foolish.  So, idiot.  And, also idiotic.  For his idiotness (A word?  You can criticize if not)."
