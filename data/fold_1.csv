How many more needless deaths in Syria would you like to see before we can  finally put an end to this?  Or are you one of those who supports hospital bombings?

The real question is why do you insist on sticking your head in the sand and pretending everything is tickety-boo in the world today?  By the way, that's exactly the type of thing which Neville Chamberlain advocated and did before WW2 and we all saw how that situation ending up getting resolved.  

History is doomed to be repeated when fools like yourself ignore what's happening.  I'm not suggesting another World War, but under no circumstances should this Syrian Civil War ever have gotten to the point it is today... especially if Obama and his administration had exhibited the backbone to act decisively back in 2012."

Thus, they're more likely to be stopped for something and have a rap sheet once a drug charge comes along.""

Vaughn also seems to conveniently forget that Germany is a country in which over 22% of residents are not born in Germany. This fact completely and utterly destroys the writer's claims about inherent German xenophobia.

Vaughn's attempts to ground current German attitudes and behavior in Prussia and the Soviet occupation is like me trying to say that Canadians love to travel because of Canada's experience in the fur trade; or saying that Canadians are anti-American because of the war of 1812. Just plain stupid.
