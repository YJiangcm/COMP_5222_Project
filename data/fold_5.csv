This is not Canada ...with a bunch of ¬´ Loyalists ¬ª Orangemen.

After the establishment of the Canadian Federation (1867), the English speaking several provinces attended helplessly to the adoption of several LAWS and regulations, anti-Catholic and anti-French in English Canada, especially in that regard to denominational schools outside Qu√©bec.
Anti-Catholic and anti-French attitude drew its source, among others, the fact that many of the Loyalists who came to Qu√©bec after the American Revolution of 1775 (Eastern Townships/ Ontario and Western Provinces) were ""Orangemen"" convinced.  Orangemen advocated an anti-Catholic and anti-French doctrine, inspired by the reconquest of England in 1690 by the Protestant Prince William III of Orange.‚Ä¶
